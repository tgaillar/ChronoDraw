This is ChronoDraw, a short PERL script to convert a plain-text waveforms description into a shiny SVG timing diagram.

ChronoDraw currently relies on the SVG PERL module to generate the output file (see http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVG/).
Just unpack the SVG package next to the script or in the directory from where the script is launched and rename it to SVG
(extensive search is performed for SVG.pm, SVG/SVG.pm or SVG/lib/SVG.pm, just make sure the module can be found this way).

Documentation to come soon...
